"Students" who participated
===========
These are two senior programmers who are not actual students, but who are working adults.
Albeit, they were students only in the sense of the tutorial I led, at the ITS 2019 event.

Diagrams and Software code
===========
The simple neural network from tutorial was designed to do the task of predicting an “Xor Gate” output, given two “Xor Gate” inputs. This is the typical example used to teach artificial neural  networks.

The code may be found in the [source-code](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-ITS-2019-Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-Code/tree/master/source-code) folder of this repository.
